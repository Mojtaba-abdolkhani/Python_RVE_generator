# Python RVE generator
This Python code creates a representative volume element (RVE) of cortical bone tissues which contains a matrix, fibers, and porosity, and simulates the fracture process using phase-field and cohesive zone models.

This script requires a phase-field model UMAT subroutine to submit the created Abaqus input file.
